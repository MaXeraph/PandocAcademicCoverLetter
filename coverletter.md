\today

To whom it may concern,

This letter is to express my interest in the posting on the PEY job portal for the <role>. With my on-going study for the Specialist Computer Science degree and my skills using Flask and React, I am confident that I will bring tremendous value to the role and the company.

Through out my development journey, I have been a part of many projects, either with my classmates or my team in Hackathons. I consider myself to be a "back-end" person. Ever since I managed to deploy my first API using Python through BeautifulSoup, I have had massive interests in backend/server development. The API, still under development, has been quite a stepping stone for me and my projects. Through it, I experienced first-hand an API's wide application and the importance of constant improvements.

I have always enjoyed working with computers ever since I wanted to be a game developer. So much that I have dedicated more than half of my degree to Computer Science courses.

I am currently branching myself to other sector of development, hence why React, NodeJS is my current obssession. For I wanted to know why it's one of the most popular frameworks in the industry. As of the time of writing, I'm currently working closely with a non-profit to deploy a prototype. As well as a course project where my team are designing and building an React/Redux app to address one of the main issues in our local varsity lives.

Besides my technical skills, I am also fortunate enough to be part of the Apple Store team at Eaton Centre. Where I am constantly in contact with many personalities and numerous customers. Working at the Apple Store has really shown me the significance of teamwork and communication. That we are working to build each other up, to enrich everyone's lives. 

I am a team-player, as well as a skillful developer. I strongly believe that I can bring tremendous values to the team and the company as an <ROLE> at <COMPANY>

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
